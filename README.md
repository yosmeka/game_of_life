# game_of_life
A simulation of Conway's game of life. A GUI software developped using Java and its Swing and AWT packages.

Conway's game of life is a zero player game (meaning that we only give it some input. It evolves based on that
input and the rules of the game). It has 4 simple rules. The game of life is of great interest for the scientific community 
and particularly mathematicians because of the unimaginable complexity it exhibits based on those 4 simple rules. It 
resembles our universe because we also observe very complex phenomena in the usiverse all governed by not so many scientific 
laws and principles.

Java source codes and compiled bitecodes of the software can be found in this repository. Anyone interested in running
the software (the simulation) needs to compile the sourse code or use the already compiled bitecode. I compiled the
source code using JDK 11.
